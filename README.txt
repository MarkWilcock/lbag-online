These are the materials for the online events that London Business Analytics Group (LBAG) is running during the lockdown while we can't meet in person. Each folder is for a separate session and usually contaibs the dataset used in any demos and a worked example Power BI Desktop file (a .PBIX file).

There is a playlist of short videos on  YouTube at  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVlQKJFc2plygl1ArhZ1rdUOaUcBZiblf .  These are summaries of weekly live events.  This also includes a five minute introduction to the series.

All our events are listed at  https://www.meetup.com/London-Business-Group.
