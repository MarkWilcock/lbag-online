This folder contains an example Python script to load an external CSV data file, clean the data (drop some columns, rename other columns, change datatypes), and save as a lakehouse table.  There is also some code to analyse and visualise the dataset.

The script is provided both as a notebook (.ipynb) and Python (.py) file.
